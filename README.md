## Setup Virtual Environment

### Create Environment
- 'python -m venv .venv' 
    'python -m venv...' = command needed to set environment up
    'v.venv' = name of the folder created for the virtual environment
- Python git ignore will have some standard naming conventions already; if not need to add manually
- No need to push the virtual environment up into Github because this is only to enable us to run it loccally. Once we've completed the cloud deployment, the host we're using, the VE will be on it there & will not be read from GitHub.

### Activate Environment
